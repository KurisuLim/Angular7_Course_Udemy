# Angular 7 Course Udemy

This is a code repository for Angular 7 course that I am taking in Udemy.
This course I am taking in Udemy will have 32 sections and will be a 28 hours length
of course. Which will be like 40 hours, if I am going to take breaks and try to learn
the material more.

Other purpose of this repository is just in case I forgot something, I can always go back
in this source code and read the code on what I learned.
